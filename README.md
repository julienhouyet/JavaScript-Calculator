## Introduction

The aim of this project is to improve my skills in Vanilla JavaScript by creating a functional and intuitive calculator. The main objective is to make a calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

## :sparkles: Current Features

The calculator offers a comprehensive suite of functionalities designed for both simplicity and efficiency. Users can currently:

- **Perform Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Easily execute fundamental mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Sign Inversion**: Quickly invert the sign of any given number, allowing for seamless transitions between positive and negative values.
- **Percentage Function**: Instantly calculate percentages by using the percentage button, simplifying tasks like calculating discounts, tax rates, or any other percentage-based calculations by dividing the number by 100.
- **Numeric Keypad Support**: Enable support for numeric keypad input, allowing for faster data entry and an improved user experience.

## :soon: Upcoming Features

I'm working to enhance the calculator's capabilities. Here's a sneak peek at what's on our development roadmap:

- **Operation History**: Implement an operation history feature to allow users to view previous calculations, enhancing usability and convenience.


## :zap: Usage

### :electric_plug: Installation

Before you start, make sure you have Node.js installed on your system (preferably the latest version). If you're not sure, run `node -v` in your terminal to check your Node.js version. If you don't already have Node.js installed, you can download it from [the official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en). I recommend using the latest LTS (Long Term Support) version.

To install the project, follow these steps:

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:julienhouyet/javascript-calculator.git
```

Navigate into the project directory
```shell
$ cd javascript-calculator
```

Install the dependencies :

```shell
$ npm install
```

###  :arrow_forward: Running the Project

Once the installation is complete, you're ready to run the project.

To start the project, run this command :

```shell
$ npm run start
```

The application will then be available at http://localhost:5173 (or a different port if 5173 is in use, which will be indicated in your terminal).

###  :package: Other Commands

Build the project for production:

```shell
$ npm run build
```

Preview the production build:

```shell
$ npm run preview
```
